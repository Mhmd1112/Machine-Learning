# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction (In Progress)

## 🧠 Overview  
This project explores the **Titanic Dataset** to prepare it for **Machine Learning** models.  
It aims to identify which factors influenced passenger survival during the Titanic disaster.  
Currently, the project is focused on **data preprocessing** and **feature engineering** steps.

## ⚙️ Work Done So Far  
✅ **Data Cleaning:**  
Handled missing values, removed inconsistencies, and simplified columns for better analysis.  

📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
Visualized patterns and correlations between key features such as age, gender, class, and survival rate.  

🧩 **Feature Engineering:**  
Created new informative features like:
- **FamilySize** → combining `SibSp` and `Parch`  
- **Title Extraction** → from passenger names  
- **IsAlone** → indicating passengers traveling alone

## 🚀 Next Steps  
🔹 Train and evaluate ML models using algorithms such as:  
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  

🔹 Compare model accuracy and optimize feature selection.
