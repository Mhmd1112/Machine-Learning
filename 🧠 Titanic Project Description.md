Titanic Survival Prediction (in progress)

This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to prepare it for Machine Learning models.
So far, the work covers:

Data Cleaning: handling missing values and inconsistent data

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): understanding relationships between features and survival rate

Feature Engineering: creating new meaningful features (like family size, title extraction, etc.) to improve model performance

The next step will be model training and evaluation using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
